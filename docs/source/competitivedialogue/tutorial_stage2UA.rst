If on first stage you set ``procurementMethodType`` to ``CompetitiveDialogueUA``
then on second stage you have tender witch similar to Open UA procedure

Modifying tender
----------------


You can modify only ``tenderPeriod.endDate`` and ``deliveryDate`` for ``items``. Another changes will not be saved.
Let's update tender by supplementing it with all other essential properties:

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/patch-tender-periods.http
   :code:

.. XXX body is empty for some reason (printf fails)

We see the added properies have merged with existing tender data. Additionally, the `dateModified` property was updated to reflect the last modification datestamp.

Checking the listing again reflects the new modification date:

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/tender-listing-after-patch.http
   :code:


Procuring entity can not change tender if there are less than 7 days before tenderPeriod ends. Changes will not be accepted by API.

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/update-tender-after-enqiery.http
   :code:

That is why tenderPeriod has to be extended by 7 days.

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/update-tender-after-enqiery-with-update-periods.http
   :code:


.. index:: Document

Uploading documentation
-----------------------

Procuring entity can upload PDF files into the created tender. Uploading should
follow the :ref:`upload` rules.

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/upload-tender-notice.http
   :code:

`201 Created` response code and `Location` header confirm document creation.
We can additionally query the `documents` collection API endpoint to confirm the
action:

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/tender-documents.http
   :code:

The single array element describes the uploaded document. We can upload more documents:

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/upload-award-criteria.http
   :code:

And again we can confirm that there are two documents uploaded.

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/tender-documents-2.http
   :code:

In case we made an error, we can reupload the document over the older version:

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/update-award-criteria.http
   :code:

And we can see that it is overriding the original version:

.. include:: tutorial/stage2/UA/tender-documents-3.http
   :code:


.. index:: Enquiries, Question, Answer

Setting contract value
----------------------

By default contract value `amount` and `amountNet` is set based on the award value `amount`, but there is a possibility to set custom contract value.

You can update `amount` and `amountNet` following next rules:

+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Value `amountNet` should be less or equal to `amount` |
+-------------------------------------------------------+

For contract value with `valueAddedTaxIncluded` set to `true`:


+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| `amount`    | Should be less or equal to ``award.value.amount``      |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| `amountNet` | Should be less or equal to ``award.value.amount``      |
+             +--------------------------------------------------------+
|             | Can be less than ``contract.value.amount`` for 20% max |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

For contract value with `valueAddedTaxIncluded` set to `false`:

+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| `amount`    | Should be greater or equal to ``award.value.amount``         |
+             +--------------------------------------------------------------+
|             | Can be greater than ``contract.value.amountNet`` for 20% max |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+
| `amountNet` | Should be less or equal to ``award.value.amount``            |
+-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------+

Let's set contract contract value with next request:

   :code:

`200 OK` response was returned. The value was modified successfully.
