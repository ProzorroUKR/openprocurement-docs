"In addition to providing fields and their values in a request, you may "
"also specify options to control how your request is interpreted and how "
"the response is generated.  For GET requests, options are specified as "
"URL parameters prefixed with `opt_`.  For POST or PUT requests, options "
"are specified in the body, inside the top-level options object (a sibling"
" of the data object).  The option specified in the body overrides the "
"`opt_` one from URL parameter."

"Provides the response in \"pretty\" output.  In case of JSON this means "
"doing proper line breaking and indentation to make it readable.  This "
