"There is a cluster of several servers that synchronize data between each "
"other. Client should always work with the same server to ensure "
"consistency between separate requests to the CDB. That is why cookie is "
"required while sending POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests. Cookies provide "
"server stickiness. You can get such cookie via GET request and then use "
"it for POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE."

"If during operations the server requested by cookie went down or is "
"unavailable, client will receive :ref:`status code 412 <errors>` of "
"request and new cookie to use. Request should be repeated with new "
"cookie."
